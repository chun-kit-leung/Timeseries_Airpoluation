####The data set includes hourly air pollutants data from 12 nationally-controlled air-quality monitoring sites. The air-quality data are from the Beijing
Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center. The meteorological data in each air-quality site are matched with the nearest weather station from the
China Meteorological Administration. The time period is from March 1st, 2013 to February 28th, 2017. Missing data are denoted as NA.

####This project aims to discover the relationship between weather anf air-quality in Beijing.
